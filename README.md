Current state of the project: acceptable. Assistance in troubleshooting is appreciated.

**HOW TO INSTALL:**

Download latest release, unpack somewhere (does not have to be inside game's folder).

**HOW TO USE:**

Press "Select path", navigate to Rain World's root folder, press Apply.

Mod list is refreshed every time you focus main window. Allows setting tags and descriptions for mods to search through later, in case you have a gigantic modset that's too annoying to get through manually.

The app has a bunch of additional tools, check Options menu.
